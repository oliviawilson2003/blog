When setting up a [**data processing pipeline in Python**](https://www.yourquorum.com/question/how-do-you-create-a-data-processing-pipeline-in-python?utm_source=github_sh&utm_medium=social_sh&utm_campaign=blog), it is possible to accomplish the goal and have fun at the same time. It simply involves assembling unprocessed data, a job that involves preparation of data for multiple purposes. But when working with iOS, extending a set of algorithms and using the CI/CD pipeline for iOS is critical for successful collaboration. To make progress in the construction of a Python data pipeline and understanding how it can be integrated with iOS development let’s analyze the process step by step.


### What’s a Python Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline implies a mechanism that is used to handle data from one stage to the other. It involves the gathering of information; analyzing the information collected; and sometimes the end result is storing the information or else using the information. In Python, if you need classical data manipulation you can use Pandas or more powerful and scalable – Dask.

Here’s a simple example:
<pre> 
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Sam'],
        'Age': [28, 22, 35]}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Simple transformation
df['AgePlusFive'] = df['Age'] + 5

print(df)
</pre>

This small pipeline takes data, processes it by adding 5 to each age of the person and then dispalys the output.

### Adding Algorithms to Your Pipeline

Data processing doesn’t end with simple transformations. There is a provision to incorporate [**algorithms**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for datamining. For example, if outcomes data is to be predicted, this could be linked with decision trees, neural networks or the like.

Suppose we intend to perform a linear regression analysis in order to predict age from name length. You could use **scikit-learn** for this:

<pre>
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Create feature (length of names) and target (age)
X = np.array([len(name) for name in df['Name']]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = df['Age']

# Initialize and fit model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict new value
prediction = model.predict([[4]])  # For a name length of 4
print(prediction)
</pre>

This will estimate the age from the size of a name. While simple, this shows how to integrate machine learning into the pipeline.

### Integrating CI/CD for iOS

That brings me to the point: integrating a [**CI/CD pipeline for iOS**](https://www.yourquorum.com/question/how-to-set-up-a-ci-cd-pipeline-for-your-ios-app-using-fastlane-and-github-actions?utm_source=github_sh&utm_medium=social_sh&utm_campaign=blog) now that you have a data pipeline with algorithms. CI/CD means Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. Precisely, it eliminates the need to test and deploy code, and it helps to avoid the situation when code becomes stale or does not function.

The easiest way to integrate your Python pipeline with an iOS app is to make it automatic. This is how you can use CI/CD on **GitHub Actions** — Here is a basic format on how to setup ci/cd.

1.  **Set up GitHub repository**: Create a GitHub repository for both your Python code and your iOS app.
    
2.  **Write a CI configuration file**: The name of the workflow can be set as you wish, but for the specific example, you should create an .github/workflows/ci.yml file in your repo. This could look like:
    
<pre>
    name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest
</pre>

This configuration will help in installing Python dependencies, performing test runs and checking whether the Python code is alright before any merge is done.

1.  **CI/CD for iOS**: For iOS, the two common ways are **Xcode Cloud** and **Fastlane** for both building and deployment of the app Once Fastlane can be integrated into GitHub Actions for iOS.
    
Here’s a simple Fastlane setup for deploying your app:

<pre>import pandas as pd</pre>

This will lead you through the process of setup. Once the Fastlane is defined, it is possible to use it to compile and deploy the app onto the App Store or even to testing without developing it from the scratch.

### Connecting Everything Together

The last process is to integrate the Python data pipeline with iOS. To expose your Python algorithm as an API you have the freedom to choose **Flask** or **FastAPI**. As a result, this API can be called by the iOS app to provide itself the processed data or predictions.

Here’s a quick example of creating a simple API with Flask:

<pre>
    from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict/<name>', methods=['GET'])
def predict_age(name):
    age_prediction = model.predict([[len(name)]])
    return jsonify({'predicted_age': age_prediction[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</pre>

Using this API your iOS app will be able to send a request for get predictions.

### Conclusion

It is fairly easy to create a **data processing pipeline in Python**, even more so if you’re incorporating algorithms to process and predict data. Bringing **CI/CD for iOS** means elaborate, uninterrupted, and automatic processes for code from Python as well as iOS. Integrating these parts will give you a robust system fit for any data driven iOS application.
